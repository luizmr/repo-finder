## üíª About project

Personal project built to test some JavaScript abilities using webpack, axios and babel. This project uses Github API to find repositories, where you can enter an username/repository name, click on "Adicionar", and it will return the data of repository, containing:

-   User profile image
-   Repository name
-   Repository description
-   And a button containing a link which you can access the repository on Github

This project can be improved (it is already responsive), but I did it just to study webpack, so feel free to use this project.
